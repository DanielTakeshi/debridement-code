This is Sanjay's code.

- `lear.py`: I think this is like the mono calibration I have.
- `lear-anlge.py`: I think this is similar to the mono calibration I have, except that it uses joint angles so it might be more directly relevant for me.
- `test.py`: I think executing a quick test trajectory using the xyz and 3-D rotation system.
- `test-angle.py`:  I think executing a quick trajectory using the joint angle system.
- `demonstrate.py`: not sure yet ... probably when he collects the 100 demonstrations, as he did for needle picking.
- `execute_grasp.py`: ... not sure yet
- `execute_grasp2.py`: logs time steps ... I see 7 things, but where's the 15?
