# Scripts

- `mapping.py` is important, conerts between pixels to robot/camera stuff.

- `calibrate_onearm.py` is when I do my manual stuff with the DVRK's arms.

- `check_calib_points.py` is purely debugging.

- `check_camera_location.py` is for checking the original camera position, MAYBE useful if the camera gets hit and its location changes. But in general there's no easy way to recover from that so BE CAREFUL!
