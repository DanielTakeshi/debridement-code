# Automatic Trajectory Collector

I *really* hope this automatic trajectory collector will work.

Run `scripts/automatic_trajectory_collector.py` to get data. Run it twice. The first helps to determine the safe boundaries for the stuff I can command. The second is when I actually run things.

You can rename a `guidelines.p` file to a backup in case you want to regenerate one of them.
