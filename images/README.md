# Images

For images after my UAI trip. Note that some of the images that were used to check calibration are not here.

## Check regressors

- Version 00 is for the rigid body only mapping.
- Version 01 is for the rigid body AND random forest mapping (but it's not the correct way to use the RF corrector...).
- Version 02 uses the rigid body and the BETTER random forest mapping.

## Visuals

This is for calibration. Versions 0 and 1 are a bit awry because I forgot to delete the pickle files and also version 1 crashed ...

- Version 0: rigid body only.
- Version 1: rigid body w/RF trained with it, but not so good.
- Version 2: the rigid body with BETTER random forest.
- Version 99: for debugging.
