# Images

For images after my UAI trip. Note that some of the images that were used to check calibration are not here.

## Check regressors

- Version 00 is for the rigid body only mapping.
- Version 01 is for the rigid body AND random forest mapping.

## Visuals

This is for calibration. Versions 0 and 1 are a bit awry because I forgot to delete the pickle files and also version 1 crashed ...

- Version 0: rigid body only.
- Version 1: rigid body w/RF trained with it, but not so good.
