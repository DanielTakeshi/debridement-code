# Images

For images after my UAI trip. Note that some of the images that were used to check calibration are not here.

- `left_image.jpg` used for drawing stuff on.

## Check regressors

- Version 00 is for the rigid body only mapping.
- Version 01 is for the rigid body AND random forest mapping (but it's not the correct way to use the RF corrector...).
- Version 02 uses the rigid body and the BETTER random forest mapping, and no x-offsets.
- Version 03 uses the rigid body and the BETTER random forest mapping AND x-offset of -0.5 millimeter.
- Version 04 uses the rigid body and the BETTER random forest mapping AND x-offset of -1 millimeter.

## Visuals

(There's a README in this directory.)

## Seeds

These are for saving the initial images from the open loop stuff, since I want to argue that any errors we have will be because of perception problems, not calibration.
