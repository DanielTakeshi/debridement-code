# Results from mapping

## Parameter Dictionary

Version 00 is the first one, with the initial 36 for each the left and right cameras. Nothing much else to say.

I also print the text output, for debugging and sanity checks. Things look good here, FYI.

Version 10 is for the "Monopolar Curved Scissors." With 35 points.

## Random Forest Predictor

We're also going to put the random forest mapping here, this one trained on my human data (not done beforehand) ... version 0 is again the first trial with the 36 data points.
