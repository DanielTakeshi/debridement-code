# Human Demonstrations

This contains human demonstrations so that I can perform behavioral cloning per time.

- `demos_seeds_03.p` is for the flat phantom tissue from Steve with NO raised barrier, and eight seeds.
- `demos_seeds_04.p` is for the flat phantom tissue from Steve WITH the barrier, and eight seeds.

Both of these should use the same rough configuration to make the problem actually solvable.

Files `demos_seeds_03_maps.p` and `demos_seeds_04_maps.p` are, of course, the pickle files with the random forest mappings I need.
